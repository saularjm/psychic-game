# Psychic Game

- In this project, I created a simple game deployed in the web browser. 
The computer chooses a random letter of the alphabet and the user has
9 chances to guess the correct letter.

## Overview
 
- Incorrect guesses are recorded and listed for the user, as well as a running 
count of how many guesses they have left. 
- At the end of each round, a win or a loss is recorded for
the user and the game restarts automatically
- The game is presented in a Bootstrap Jumbotron setting.
